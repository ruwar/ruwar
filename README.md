### Hello and welcome to my Github profile!  ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ruwar Bradosti, and I'm a 36-year-old entrepreneur with a passionate interest in technology and design. I love exploring new technical solutions and developing my own apps, and Github is a platform that allows me to do just that.

As an entrepreneur, I've always been fascinated by how technology can improve people's lives, and I believe that coding is one of the most powerful tools we have to realize that potential. My goal with Github is to continue learning, experimenting, and developing new ideas that can make a real difference in the world.

If you're interested in collaborating on a project or just want to talk tech and design, don't hesitate to reach out to me. Together, we can create something truly exciting!
